In this formula R, G and B stand for intensities of the red, green and blue,
respectively. This formula also gives the impact of individual color changes
on the overall grey level and indicates the significance of the green
component.(This was used in my diploma thesis. Used for video processing.)

There is no one "correct" conversion from RGB to grayscale, since it depends 
on the sensitivity response curve of your detector to light as a function of 
wavelength.(Used in the Gimp for greyscale conversion)
The weights used to compute luminance are related to the monitor's phosphors. 
The explanation for these weights is due to the fact that for equal amounts of 
color the eye is most sensitive to green, then red, and then blue. This means that 
for equal amounts of green and blue light the green will, nevertheless, seem much 
brighter. Thus, the image obtained by the normal averaging of an image's three color 
components produces a grayscale brightness that is not perceptually equivalent to the 
brightness of the original color image. The weighted sum that defines GREY, however, does.
