Finding Clones


What is it?
-----------

Finding clones is a dissertation for the School of Informatics of University of Edinburgh. The main purpose 
is to implement three efficient image algorithms for finding the same objects in a given 2-D image. The 
implementation will be in ANSI C language. The source code of reading the images and evaluating them is provided 
by the algorithm contest home page organised by SIG PRMU (Pattern Recognition and Media Understanding)
of the IEICE (Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers), Japan in 2009. The site is
